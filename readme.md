# Simple Neural Network from scratch
In this repo we implement a simple API that can be used to create simple sequential NN models. It will only use numpy, so we will have to implement everything manualy.
API features:
* Creating a model with a ``Model`` class.
* Choose an error function for the model
* Add layers (Fully Connected, Flatten, Softmax, ...)
* Choose an activation function
* Fit the model
* Predict with a model
